<h1>Progressive Enhancement with Path.js</h1>
<p>
This little demo uses Path.js and jQuery to progressively enhance
the navigation on this minisite.
Without JavaScript, the site consists of two pages:
<a href="/pages/introduction">introduction</a> and 
<a href="/pages/progressive">progressive</a>.
With JavaScript, the site turns into a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single Page Application</a>
that updates the content dynamically using AJAX requests.
</p>

<h2>The baseline: everything serverside</h2>
For browsers without JavaScript, we generate the two pages on the server.
This is easily done with a few lines of code in <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>:
<pre>
<%=escape_html <<-eos
get '/' do
  redirect "/pages/introduction"
end

get '/pages/:page' do |page|
  erb :index, :locals => {:page => page}
end
eos
%></pre>

Additionally, there are three templates:
<a href="https://github.com/micheljansen/progressive_demo/blob/master/views/layout.erb">layout.erb</a>,
which contains the general structure of the page, with the navigation bar etc.
and two partial templates that contain just the content that is unique to that page:
<a href="https://github.com/micheljansen/progressive_demo/blob/master/views/introduction.erb">introduction.erb</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/micheljansen/progressive_demo/blob/master/views/progressive.erb">progressive.erb</a>.
The contents of introduction.erb or progressive.erb are rendered inside layout.erb in place of the "yield" expression.

<h2>Making it dynamic: Path.js</h2>
<p>
Now that we have a working baseline, we can progressively enhance that
using AJAX to fetch just the content we want and smoothly replace that on the page.
As explained in the <a href="/pages/introduction">introduction</a>,
this is hard to do without messing up the browser history and URL bar.
</p>

<p>
This is why we use 
<a href="https://github.com/mtrpcic/pathjs">Path.js</a>;
a very simple JavaScript routing library.
At the time of writing it is under 200 lines of code.
It allows you to map URLs to actions
that you can act on in JavaScript.
Path.js even supports the 
<a href="https://github.com/mtrpcic/pathjs/wiki/HTML5-PushState">HTML5 History API via PushState</a>
so it is able to maintain a consistent state of the address bar while keeping
back button functionality intact.
</p>

<p>
The heart of the trick fits in a few lines of JavaScript (simplified):

<pre>
<%=escape_html <<-eos
// Define Route
Path.map("/pages/:page").to(function(){
  $("#content").html("loading...");

  $.ajax("/partials/"+this.params["page"])
    .done(function(data) {
      $("#content").html(data)
    })
})

// Wire links to go through Path using jQuery
$(document).ready(function(){
  Path.history.listen()

  $("a").live("click", function(event){
    if(Path.match(url)) {
      event.preventDefault()
      Path.history.pushState({}, "", $(this).attr("href"))
    }
  });
})
eos
%></pre>

What this does is catch all links to "/pages/pagename"
and perform an AJAX request to "/partials/pagename" instead.
</p>

<p>
What remains, is adding some code on the server side
to serve the partial content:
<pre>
<%=escape_html <<-eos
def partial(template, options = {})
  erb template.to_sym, options.merge({:layout => false})
end

get '/partials/:partial' do |page|
  partial page
end
eos
%></pre>
</p>

<p>
That's all!
Using JavaScript, we can now add some nice transitions, animations etc.
but the meat of the work is done.
The same templates are used whether the page is loaded from <code>index.erb</code>
or served up as a partial via AJAX, so there is no duplication of code.
</p>

<h2>Making it even nicer</h2>
<p>
Having a special route for the partial content feels a bit redundant.
Fortunately, it is easy to use the same route for both rendered and partial content:
<pre>
<%=escape_html <<-eos
get '/pages/:page' do |page|
  if request.xhr?
    partial page
  else
    erb page.to_sym, {:locals => {:page => page}}
  end
end
eos
%></pre>

Now it serves us the whole layout plus content on regular requests,
and just the partial content for AJAX requests.
